<!-- As a multiplayer-only video game,[1] Rust pits players against each other in a harsh, open world environment with the sole goal of survival. Animals, such as wolves and bears, act as a looming threat, but the primary danger comes from other players.[1] Most maps are procedurally generated,[2] with the exception of some pre-built maps.[3] When beginning, a player only has a rock and a torch. The rock can cut down trees, break apart stones, and be used as a weapon. Cloth and food can be gathered by killing animals; mining provides stone, metal ore, and sulfur ore; and chopping down trees provides wood.[4] To survive in the world, the player must gather resources and use them to craft tools, weapons, and other gear.[5][6] To craft items, the player must have a sufficient amount of all required materials,[7] with advanced items needing more obscure components scattered around the map.[8] There are limitations imposed on the amount of craftable items, with blueprints allowing the creation of more advanced items.[7]

The player must stay fed or they will die of starvation. There are other challenges the player must overcome during gameplay, such as drowning, hypothermia, and wildlife attacksâ€”primarily bears and wolves.[9] Specific locales around the map are radioactive, with four levels of radiation: minor, low, medium, and high. The correct armour or clothing must be worn to enter these areas; failure to do so can result in death.[10] Upon death, a screen with an option to respawn at a random location or at a sleeping bag or bed (placed prior to death) appears. Respawning resets the player's inventory to the basic rock and torch. Rust is sometimes played in a "clan". Clans usually create housing for their members, give items and supplies to each other and partake in organised raiding and looting.[11][12][13] Player vs player (PvP) combat is accomplished with bows, melee weapons and craftable guns.[14] Bullets and other projectiles travel in a ballistic trajectory, rather than being hitscan.[3][15] There are a number of different types of bullet for each gun, including high velocity and explosive,[16] thus allowing for more diverse strategy.[17] Hit tracking calculates damage;[3] shots to the head are more damaging than shots to other parts of the body.[18][19] The use of weapon attachments, such as holographic sights, provide an advantage over -->
